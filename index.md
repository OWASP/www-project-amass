## Our Goal

In-depth DNS Enumeration, Attack Surface Mapping and External Asset Discovery!

The OWASP Amass Project has developed a tool to help information security professionals perform network mapping of attack surfaces and perform external asset discovery using open source information gathering and active reconnaissance techniques.

If you have any questions about the OWASP Amass Project, please email the project leader [Jeff Foley](mailto://jeff.foley@owasp.org), or contact us on the project's Discord server (**Discord is highly preferred**).

## Participation

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our projects ,tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security.

### How can I participate in the project?

All you have to do is make the Project Leader aware of your available time to [contribute to the project](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). It is also important to let the leader know how you would like to contribute and pitch in to help the project meet its goals and milestones. There are many different ways you can contribute to an OWASP Project, but communication with the leader is key.

### If I am not a programmer can I participate in the project?

Yes, you can certainly participate in the project if you are not a programmer. The project needs different skills and expertise at different times during its development. Currently, we are looking for researchers, programmers, writers, and graphic designers.
