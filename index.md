## Our Goal

In-depth attack surface management for everyone!

The OWASP Amass Project has developed a framework to help information security professionals perform network mapping of attack surfaces and external asset discovery using open source intelligence gathering and reconnaissance techniques.

The framework includes a collection engine for asset discovery, an asset database for storage of findings, and the Open Asset Model, used by various tooling to help understand attack surfaces.

If you have any questions about the OWASP Amass Project, please email the project leader [Jeff Foley](mailto://jeff.foley@owasp.org), or contact us on the project's [Discord server](https://discord.gg/HNePVyX3cp) (**Discord is highly preferred**).
